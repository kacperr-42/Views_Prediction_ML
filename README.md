A supervised machine learning project aiming to predict how popular a song would be on youtube.<br>
Initail idea was to use regession models, but it turned out that based on used dataset it is impossible.<br>
To resolve this issue we decided to train classification model that assigns the song one of 3 level of popularity.<br>
